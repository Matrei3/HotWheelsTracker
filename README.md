_Hot Wheels Car Tracker_

Technologies:
  - jsoup: for web scraping data about the cars from https://hotwheels.fandom.com/wiki/Hot_Wheels
  - PostgreSQL: data persistence 
  - JavaFX + CSS: making the GUI and stylizing it

Description:
  - Firstly I retrieved the cars (1995-2024) and stored them in the DB
  - When the app is started the cars are put into a table which can be sorted/filtered to get the desired car
  - Your cars are stored locally in a .csv file

Final result:
